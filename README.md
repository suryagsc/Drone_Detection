DRONE DETECTION

In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones. These drones are not only popular for recreational purposes but also find extensive applications in engineering, disaster management, logistics and airport security. However, their increased usage has raised concerns regarding potential misuse and security threats. To tackle this issue, our project focuses on analyzing existing drone detection solutions that can effectively identify drones in real time using day and night camera feeds. Additionally, we aim to understand the challenges involved in drone detection and evaluate the accuracy and loss metrics associated with such problems. Ultimately, we will compare various drone detection solutions and recommend a suitable Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) solution that strikes the right balance between minimizing false alarms and missed detections.

This project aims to delve into the intricacies of the YOLOv3 algorithm in object detection, with a primary focus on comprehending and implementing various techniques to enhance its performance. The ultimate goal is to achieve superior results when processing the provided test data.
